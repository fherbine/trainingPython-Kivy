Ex1:
Create a simple "hello world" app and run it on port 8080.
- the files must be called 'hello_world.py' and 'hello_world.sh'
- make sure you have access to it with your webbrowser
- run it in 'development' mode

Ex2:
Create multiple pages "Salade Tomate Oignons":
- scripts must be called "sto.py" and "sto.sh"
- The app should run on port 5432
- On your route you'll have the famous question "Quelle sauce ?"
- Then you'll have pages "salade", "tomates" and "oignons"

Ex3:
